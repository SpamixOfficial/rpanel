- A status panel, supporting (at least) spotify and discord RPC
- User plugins? 
    - Python?
    - Configs?
- Layout should be configurable
    - Configuration or visual layout editor?
        - Combination? (Visual editor like a tiling WM, but saves to text format, preferably JSON)
    - Layout inside tab could be determined by XML? Or HTML?
    - Actually just configure everything as XML with hot reload
